This will be a half-year project for me as I learn and apply data analytics to my passion of film.


Predicting opening weekend gross is important because:
1) it demonstrates the commercial viability of the film
2) setting expectations for investors, producers, and other stakeholders
3) records- people love to break records, the media and pundits (and people like myself) eat this up

Today, the opening weekend gross for most movies is not accurately predictable. The notable exceptions are any Disney/Pixar/Marvel moves, and any franchise movies (i.e., Mission Impossible, Bourne, etc).

My hunch is that there is a way to use machine learning to predict opening weekend gross.

I know that we could use regressions based on what I learned in college. We need to find a series of variables, controls, and set up a the test. That is where I will start with. The approach:
  1. Find a reliable source for historical film data
  2. Find the most comprehensive set of variables to use based on that data
  3. Clean up the data in a csv file
  4. Use python/pandas to interpret the data. Sources:

  5. Find the 5 strongest predictors of gross 
    Current hunches: star power, director, time of release, sequel, cost to make including marketing
  6. Use these predictors to make recommendation for how to create the largest box office opening gross ever
  7. Predict the gross of upcoming movies based on the results

Given everything else on my plate, I'm expecting this process to take until the end of summer 2016.

After this, it's time to make this thing visually appealling. By this point, I've hopefully learned to use some data viz tools/techniques and can apply it to this. Sources:

I'm guessing end of fall is a good/realistic timeline for completing this portion of the project.

Finally in the winter, I will be publishing and cleaning up.
